      "description": "In the National Collegiate Computer Systems Ability Competition (Operating System Track – OS Function Challenge), the team, representing Fudan University as 'This is a Team', proposed and implemented the LaCSR5-SpMV algorithm. The project optimized CSR5-based Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication for the Loongson 3A5000 architecture, leveraging SIMD instructions and multi-core features. Tested on 23 sparse matrices, the algorithm achieved up to 2.78× performance improvement. Awarded Second Prize.",
